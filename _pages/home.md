Welcome to **Beidou Information Engineering Laboratory (AIE Lab)** at the **School of Information and Artificial Intelligence, Anhui Agricultural University**, located in the **Central and Western Comprehensive Building (7th Floor, North Wing)** in Hefei, Anhui Province. Led by **Associate Professor Yunzhi Wu**, our lab focuses on cutting-edge research in **artificial intelligence (AI)** and its applications to **smart agriculture**, **environmental monitoring**, and **biological data analysis**. 

We leverage **deep learning techniques**, such as **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** and **advanced multimodal fusion models**, to address challenges in **agricultural pest detection**, **plant disease segmentation**, **soil nutrient classification**, and **biological gene retrieval**. Representative work includes **high-precision pest identification using YOLOv5**, **leaf disease segmentation with MFBP-UNet**, and **essential protein prediction through evolutionary community discovery**. **Composed primarily of undergraduate researchers**, the AIE Lab is dedicated to promoting **innovative solutions for modern agriculture**, advancing **environmental monitoring technologies**, and cultivating **future talent in AI-driven research**. For more information, please visit our [**website**](https://www.aielab.net) or [**lab homepage**](https://aielab766.github.io), or contact us via [**email**](mailto:aielab766@163.com).
